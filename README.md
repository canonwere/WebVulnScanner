# WebVulnScanner

A **Web Vulnerability Scanner** built with Python to help identify security weaknesses in web applications. This tool performs several security checks, including **port scanning**, **SSL/TLS certificate validation**, **HTTP header analysis**, and **outdated software detection**. Itâ€™s designed to give developers and security professionals insights into potential vulnerabilities in their web applications.

## Features

- **Port Scanning**: Scans the top 1024 ports to identify open and vulnerable ports on a target system.
- **SSL/TLS Certificate Checking**: Validates SSL certificates and checks for expiration.
- **HTTP Header Analysis**: Detects missing security headers like Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, etc.
- **Outdated Software Detection**: Checks for signs of outdated or vulnerable software versions.
